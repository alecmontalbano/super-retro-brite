I had significant trouble with the adjustable grid at first, but quickly discovered that simply targeting the rows ad cols of the grid with the value of the input DOM element accompanied with a submit form event listener did just the trick.

All in all I made a very simple pixel art editor. The addition of an export module, symmetry tool, and hold to fill on paths would really amp up it's usefulness.
